**Data Summary:**  

**Provenance**  
This dataset stems from a research project into automated hate speech detection [1]. The initial dataset was a collection of tweets pulled from Twitter (now X). These tweets were pulled from a site called hatebase.org, which allows Twitter users to flag potentially hateful speech. 25,000 of those tweets were then used to create a new dataset, which utilized CrowdFlower to label them as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral. This new dataset included counts of how many individuals from Crowdflower viewed the tweet and their respective categorizations, as well as a final column called “count” that summarized the votes of those individuals by assigning a value of 2 for neutral, 1 for offensive speech, and 0 for hate speech.
